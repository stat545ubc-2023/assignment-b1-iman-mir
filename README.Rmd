The goal of counter is to determine the count of different data points in a group within a data frame. 

In order to create the function, I used the R packages of devtools, dplyr and devtools.

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(dplyr)
library(testthat)
```

For analysis purposes, I chose to complete thus assignment base don the datateachr datbase. 

```{r}
library(datateachr)
```


## Files explanation 
1. assignment-b1-iman_mir.rmd is a rmd which contains 4 excercises based on the function counter
2. assignment-b1-iman_mir.md is the markdown version of the file
